GoAccess [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/allinurl/goaccess.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/allinurl/goaccess) [![GoAccess](https://goaccess.io/badge?v1.0)](http://goaccess.io)
========

## What is it? ##
GoAccess is an open source **real-time web log analyzer** and interactive
viewer that **runs in a terminal in *nix systems** or through your browser. It
provides fast and valuable HTTP statistics for system administrators that
require a visual server report on the fly.

## Features ##
GoAccess parses the specified web log file and outputs the data to the X
terminal. Features include:

* **Completely Real Time**
  All panels and metrics are timed to be updated every 200 ms on the terminal
  output and every second on the HTML output.

* **No configuration needed**
  You can just run it against your access log file, pick the log format and 
  let GoAccess parse the access log and show you the stats.

* **Track Application Response Time**
  Track the time taken to serve the request. Extremely useful if you want to
  track pages that are slowing down your site.

* **Nearly All Web Log Formats**
  GoAccess allows any custom log format string. Predefined options include,
  Apache, Nginx, Amazon S3, Elastic Load Balancing, CloudFront, etc 

* **Incremental Log Processing**
  Need data persistence? GoAccess has the ability to process logs incrementally
  through the on-disk B+Tree database.

* **Only one dependency**
  GoAccess is written in C. To run it, you only need ncurses as a dependency.
  That's it. It even features its own Web Socket server -  http://gwsocket.io/.

* **Visitors**
  Determine the amount of hits, visitors, bandwidth, and metrics for slowest
  running requests by the hour, or date.

* **Metrics per Virtual Host**
  Have multiple Virtual Hosts (Server Blocks)? A panel that displays which
  virtual host is consuming most of the web server resources.

* **Color Scheme Customizable**
  Tailor GoAccess to suit your own color taste/schemes. Either through the 
  terminal, or by simply applying the stylesheet on the HTML output.

* **Support for large datasets**
  GoAccess features an on-disk B+Tree storage for large datasets where it is not 
  possible to fit everything in memory.

### Nearly all web log formats... ###
GoAccess allows any custom log format string. Predefined options include, but
not limited to:

* Amazon CloudFront (Download Distribution).
* Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
* AWS Elastic Load Balancing
* Combined Log Format (XLF/ELF) Apache | Nginx
* Common Log Format (CLF) Apache
* Google Cloud Storage.
* Apache virtual hosts
* Squid Native Format.
* W3C format (IIS).

## Why GoAccess? ##
GoAccess was designed to be a fast, terminal-based log analyzer. Its core idea
is to quickly analyze and view web server statistics in real time without
needing to use your browser (_great if you want to do a quick analysis of your
access log via SSH, or if you simply love working in the terminal_).

While the terminal output is the default output, it has the capability to
generate a complete real-time [**`HTML`**](http://rt.goaccess.io/?src=gh)
report, as well as a [**`JSON`**](http://goaccess.io/json?src=gh), and
[**`CSV`**](http://goaccess.io/goaccess_csv_report.csv?src=gh) report.

You can see it more of a monitor command tool than anything else.

## Installation ##
GoAccess can be compiled and used on *nix systems.

Download, extract and compile GoAccess with:

    $ wget http://tar.goaccess.io/goaccess-1.1.1.tar.gz
    $ tar -xzvf goaccess-1.1.1.tar.gz
    $ cd goaccess-1.1.1/
    $ ./configure --enable-geoip --enable-utf8
    $ make
    # make install

### Build from GitHub (Development) ###

    $ git clone https://github.com/allinurl/goaccess.git
    $ cd goaccess
    $ autoreconf -fiv
    $ ./configure --enable-geoip --enable-utf8
    $ make
    # make install

## Distributions ##

It is easiest to install GoAccess on Linux using the preferred package manager
of your Linux distribution.

Please note that not all distributions will have the lastest version of
GoAccess available

#### Debian/Ubuntu ####

    # apt-get install goaccess

**NOTE:** It is likely this will install an outdated version of GoAccess. To
make sure that you're running the latest stable version of GoAccess see
alternative option below.

#### Official GoAccess Debian & Ubuntu repository ####

    $ echo "deb http://deb.goaccess.io/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/goaccess.list
    $ wget -O - http://deb.goaccess.io/gnugpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install goaccess
    
**Note**:
* For *on-disk* support (Trusty+ or Wheezy+), run: `sudo apt-get install goaccess-tcb`
* `.deb` packages in the official repo are available through https as well. You may need to install `apt-transport-https`.

#### Fedora ####

    # yum install goaccess

#### Arch Linux ####

    # pacman -S goaccess

#### Gentoo ####

    # emerge net-analyzer/goaccess

#### OS X / Homebrew ####

    # brew install goaccess

#### FreeBSD ####

    # cd /usr/ports/sysutils/goaccess/ && make install clean
    # pkg install sysutils/goaccess

#### OpenBSD ####

    # cd /usr/ports/www/goaccess && make install clean
    # pkg_add goaccess

#### OpenIndiana ####

    # pkg install goaccess

#### pkgsrc (NetBSD, Solaris, SmartOS, ...) ####

    # pkgin install goaccess

#### Windows ####

GoAccess can be used in Windows through Cygwin.

## Storage ##

There are three storage options that can be used with GoAccess. Choosing one
will depend on your environment and needs.

#### Default Hash Tables ####

In-memory storage provides better performance at the cost of limiting the
dataset size to the amount of available physical memory. By default GoAccess
uses in-memory hash tables. If your dataset can fit in memory, then this will
perform fine. It has very good memory usage and pretty good performance.

#### Tokyo Cabinet On-Disk B+ Tree ####

Use this storage method for large datasets where it is not possible to fit
everything in memory. The B+ tree database is slower than any of the hash
databases since data has to be committed to disk. However, using an SSD greatly
increases the performance. You may also use this storage method if you need
data persistence to quickly load statistics at a later date.

#### Tokyo Cabinet On-Memory Hash Database ####

An alternative to the default hash tables. It uses generic typing and thus it's
performance in terms of memory and speed is average.

## Usage ##
##### Different Outputs #####

To output to a terminal and generate an interactive report:

    # goaccess -f access.log

To generate an HTML report:

    # goaccess -f access.log -a > report.html
    
To generate a JSON report:

    # goaccess -f access.log -a -d -o json > report.json
    
To generate a CSV file:

    # goaccess -f access.log --no-csv-summary -o csv > report.csv

The `-a` flag indicates that we want to process an agent-list for every host
parsed.

The `-d` flag indicates that we want to enable the IP resolver on the HTML |
JSON output. (It will take longer time to output since it has to resolve all
queries.)

The `-c` flag will prompt the date and log format configuration window. Only
when curses is initialized.

##### Multiple Log Files #####

Filtering can be done through the use of pipes. For instance, using grep to
filter specific data and then pipe the output into GoAccess. This adds a great
amount of flexibility to what GoAccess can display. For example:

If we would like to process all `access.log.*.gz` we can do one of the following:

    # zcat -f access.log* | goaccess

    # zcat access.log.*.gz | goaccess

Note: On Mac OS X, use `gzcat` instead of `zcat`.

##### Real Time HTML Output #####

GoAccess has the ability the output real-time data in the HTML report. You can
even email the HTML file since it is composed of a single file with no external
file dependencies, how neat is that!

The process of generating a real-time HTML report is very similar to the
process of creating a static report. Only `--real-time-html` is needed to make
it real-time.

**Note** that `--ws-url` is also required *IF* GoAccess is running on a
different machine than the one used to open the html report. See
[FAQ](https://goaccess.io/faq) for more details.

    # goaccess -f access.log -o /usr/share/nginx/html/your_site/report.html --real-time-html --ws-url=host

By default, GoAccess listens on port 7890, to use a different port other than
7890, you can specify it as (make sure the port is opened):

    # goaccess -f access.log -o report.html --real-time-html --ws-url=goaccess.io --port=9870

And to bind the WebSocket server to a different address other than 0.0.0.0, you
can specify it as:

    # goaccess -f access.log -o report.html --real-time-html --ws-url=goaccess.io --addr=127.0.0.1

**Note**: To output real time data over a TLS/SSL connection, you need to use
`--ssl-cert=<cert.crt>` and `--ssl-key=<priv.key>`.

##### Working with Dates #####

Another useful pipe would be filtering dates out of the web log

The following will get all HTTP requests starting on `05/Dec/2010` until the
end of the file.

    # sed -n '/05\/Dec\/2010/,$ p' access.log | goaccess -a

or using relative dates such as yesterdays or tomorrows day:

    # sed -n '/'$(date '+%d\/%b\/%Y' -d '1 week ago')'/,$ p' access.log | goaccess -a

If we want to parse only a certain time-frame from DATE a to DATE b, we can do:

    # sed -n '/5\/Nov\/2010/,/5\/Dec\/2010/ p' access.log | goaccess -a

##### Virtual Hosts #####

Assuming your log contains the virtual host field. For instance:

    vhost.io:80 8.8.4.4 - - [02/Mar/2016:08:14:04 -0600] "GET /shop HTTP/1.1" 200 615 "-" "Googlebot-Image/1.0"

And you would like to append the virtual host to the request in order to see
which virtual host the top urls belong to

    awk '$8=$1$8' access.log | goaccess -a

To exclude a list of virtual hosts you can do the following:

    # grep -v "`cat exclude_vhost_list_file`" vhost_access.log | goaccess

##### Files & Status Codes #####

To parse specific pages, e.g., page views, `html`, `htm`, `php`, etc. within a
request:

    # awk '$7~/\.html|\.htm|\.php/' access.log | goaccess

Note, `$7` is the request field for the common and combined log format,
(without Virtual Host), if your log includes Virtual Host, then you probably
want to use `$8` instead. It's best to check which field you are shooting for,
e.g.:

    # tail -10 access.log | awk '{print $8}'

Or to parse a specific status code, e.g., 500 (Internal Server Error):

    # awk '$9~/500/' access.log | goaccess

##### Server #####

Also, it is worth pointing out that if we want to run GoAccess at lower
priority, we can run it as:

    # nice -n 19 goaccess -f access.log -a

and if you don't want to install it on your server, you can still run it from
your local machine:

    # ssh root@server 'cat /var/log/apache2/access.log' | goaccess -a

##### Incremental Log Processing #####

GoAccess has the ability to process logs incrementally through the on-disk
B+Tree database. It works in the following way:

1. A data set must be persisted first with `--keep-db-files`, then the same
data set can be loaded with `--load-from-disk`.
2. If new data is passed (piped or through a log file), it will append it to
the original data set.
3. To preserve the data at all times, `--keep-db-files` must be used.
4. If `--load-from-disk` is used without `--keep-db-files`, database files will
be deleted upon closing the program.

###### Examples ######

    // last month access log
    # goaccess -f access.log.1 --keep-db-files

then, load it with

    // append this month access log, and preserve new data
    # goaccess -f access.log --load-from-disk --keep-db-files

To read persisted data only (without parsing new data)
